## 6. Succession and Buyout Mechanism
- In the event of the death of the sole shareholder of **9280-4061 Québec inc.**, or after a fixed period determined in advance, the **49% Collective** shall buy out the 51% stake.  

### 6.1 Funding
- A portion of the **49% pool** is set aside annually in a **Buyout Reserve Fund**.  
- The contribution percentage is calculated dynamically by an algorithm to ensure the fund reaches the **target valuation (V_target)** within the set horizon (e.g., 10 years).  
- If the reserve is insufficient at the buyout date, additional payments are made from future revenues until completion.  

### 6.2 Valuation Formula
- The Buyout Price shall be defined as:  

\[
\text{Buyout Price} = 3 \times \text{Average Net Revenues over the last 3 fiscal years}
\]

- Subject to:  
  - **Minimum floor**: 1× average Net Revenues  
  - **Maximum cap**: 5× average Net Revenues  
- “Net Revenues” = gross revenues – operating expenses (excluding extraordinary items, amortization, depreciation, and discretionary excess compensation).  
- The minimum buyout price shall not be lower than the **net reserve accumulated** at the time of transfer.  

### 6.3 Execution
- The transfer of ownership is **automatic, binding, and cannot be blocked by heirs**.  
- Payment to the estate or heirs of the shareholder is made from the Buyout Reserve Fund.  
- If the Buyout Reserve Fund does not fully cover the price, the remainder shall be paid through future revenues until settlement is complete.  

### 6.4 Clarifications
1. **Definition of Net Revenues**: strictly defined as above, excluding non-cash and extraordinary items.  
2. **Control of Calculations**: performed by the Twerse DAO algorithm, validated by an **independent external auditor** jointly appointed by 9280 and the 49% Board.  
3. **Treatment of Debts**: all outstanding debts and liabilities are deducted from the Buyout Price.  
4. **Form of Payment**: at least **20% upfront** from the Reserve Fund, balance in **max 5 annual installments** with 3% indexed interest.  
5. **Status of Tokens After Buyout**: converted into **legal shares**, held through a **Voting Trust** to preserve DAO governance.  
6. **Premature Death**: if the shareholder dies before the Reserve Fund reaches 50% of target, heirs receive a **minimum 20% immediate payment**, priority over rebates.  
7. **Tax Treatment**: payments pass through a **testamentary trust**, ensuring optimal taxation and continuity.  

### 6.5 Voluntary Exit by 9280

- **9280-4061 Québec inc.** may, at its sole discretion, trigger the Buyout Mechanism defined in Section 6 at any time, without requiring proof of death, bankruptcy, or other triggering events.  
- The Buyout Price shall be calculated according to Section 6.2 (3× average net revenues of the last 3 years, subject to floor and cap).  
- Payment shall be made following the same rules as in Section 6.3 and 6.4: 20% upfront from the Buyout Reserve Fund, balance in maximum 5 annual installments, with indexed interest.  
- Upon activation of the Voluntary Exit, the Special Class Twerse Shares shall be automatically transferred to the 49% Collective, and Contributor Tokens shall be converted into legal shares as described in Section 6.4.5.
