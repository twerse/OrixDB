## üìñ Introduction
- **RSON**: an open, universal data format designed as a successor to JSON/GeoJSON.  
- **OrixDB**: the reference SEG6 fractal database engine, optimized for storing, querying, and emerging dimensional data.  

Our model is based on **Shared-Code**:  
- **Open** for universal adoption (RSON).  
- **Valorized** for fair and tiered commercial use (OrixDB).  
- **Charter** to guarantee shared governance (51/49).
